The GitHub issue tracker is for development work such as bug reports, feature requests, and design discussions. It is NOT the place for asking usage questions or seeking debugging help.

If you are looking for help or have a general usage question, you can:

- Join the [Vega Slack organization](http://bit.ly/vega-slack)
- Join the [Vega discussion forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/vega-js)
- Search or post to [StackOverflow with the "vega" tag](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vega)

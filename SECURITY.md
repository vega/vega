# Security

The Vega team and community take security bugs in Vega seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

## Reporting Security Issues

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

To report a security issue privately, please use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/vega/vega/security/advisories/new) tab.

A Vega maintainer will send a response indicating next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply, the team will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

You can also report a vulnerability through the [npm contact form](https://www.npmjs.com/support) by selecting "I'm reporting a security vulnerability".

## Preferred Languages

We prefer communications to be in English.

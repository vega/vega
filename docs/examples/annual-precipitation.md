A plot of 2016 annual global precipitation data from the [NOAA Climate Forecast System (CFS) v2](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/model-data/model-datasets/climate-forecast-system-version2-cfsv2). The data is provided as a raster grid of longitude and latitude (1&deg; per cell). Isocontours are computed against the grid and projected. Adapted from an example by [@mattijn](https://github.com/mattijn).

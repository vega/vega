A [population pyramid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_pyramid) shows the distribution of age groups within a population. This example shows males and females across 150 years of U.S. census data. Drag the slider to see the U.S. population change over time (but watch out for [missing data in 1890](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1890_United_States_Census)!).

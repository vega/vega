A gallery of world maps using various [cartographic projections](../../docs/projections). This example uses a number of projections from the [d3-geo-projection](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo-projection) library that are not included in the standard Vega release. View the source code of this page to see how the projections were registered for use with Vega! Each map clips the projected land masses and graticules to the sphere of the Earth to ensure no extraneous shapes are shown.

This is an extension of the [Circle Packing Example](../circle-packing). This version was implemented by [@giammaria](https://github.com/Giammaria). It incorporates a timer to facilitate zoom and fade animations, offering a technique beneficial for drill-down behavior and exploration. For simplicity, the example reveals only a few text marks upon zoom, corresponding to the user-selected node. Alternatively, you can render various mark types, axes, legends, etc., to provide additional insights into the selected node."

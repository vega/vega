By dividing an area chart into consecutive layers, [horizon graphs](http://idl.cs.washington.edu/papers/horizon/) present time-series data in a compact space while preserving resolution. Click the chart to change the number of layers. Though the chart size changes, the spatial resolution of the area chart stays constant.

An arc diagram visualizes a network using a one-dimensional layout of nodes and circular arcs to represent links. Though an arc diagram may not always convey the overall structure of the graph as effectively as a two-dimensional layout, with a good ordering of nodes one can identify cliques and bridges. Arc diagrams were originally invented to depict repeated musical structures in [Martin Wattenberg's The Shape of Song](http://www.bewitched.com/song.html).

Uses the Vega [crossfilter](../../docs/transforms/crossfilter) transform to perform efficient incremental updates. Click and drag to move or resize a brush, double-click to maximize, or use the scroll wheel to zoom the brush size. Based on the [Crossfilter.js](http://crossfilter.github.io/crossfilter/) example by Mike Bostock.

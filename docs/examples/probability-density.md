Visual comparison of estimated probability distributions for a sample of numeric values: a normal (Gaussian) distribution parameterized by the mean and standard deviation, and a [kernel density estimate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_density_estimation). This example supports estimates of either [probability density functions (pdf)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_density_function) or [cumulative distribution functions (cdf)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_distribution_function), using Vega's [density](../../docs/transforms/density) transform.

Summary statistics for U.S. flight data, interactively grouped by time unit. This example demonstrates the use of the [`timeunit`](../../docs/transforms/timeunit) transform, in conjunction with the [`timeSequence`](../../docs/expressions/#timeSequence) and [`timeUnitSpecifier`](../../docs/expressions/#timeUnitSpecifier) expression functions, to flexibly process and format date-time data.

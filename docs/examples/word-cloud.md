A [word cloud (or tag cloud)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_cloud) depicts text data, typically by sizing each word proportionally to its frequency within the text. Vega's [wordcloud](../../docs/transforms/wordcloud) transform uses a layout similar to [Wordle](http://www.wordle.net/), based on [Jason Davies' wordcloud implementation](https://www.jasondavies.com/wordcloud/). This example visualizes frequent words in the abstracts of published [research papers](../../about/research) from the Vega project.

The [Job Voyager](http://idl.cs.washington.edu/papers/voyagers-and-voyeurs-cacm) is an interactive stacked graph of occupations based on 150 years of U.S. census data. Either click elements or type queries to explore. The search box supports regular expressions; for example the query `"ist$"` finds all jobs ending with "ist".

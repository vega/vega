A dot plot of average yields for a variety of barley strains, with error bars indicating the spread of values. Vega can visualize pre-calculated error ranges or apply a number of standard measures. Use the drop down menu to visualize different measures of spread, including the 95% [confidence interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval) of the mean (calculated via [bootstrapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_(statistics))), [standard error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_error), [standard deviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation), and the [interquartile range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interquartile_range).

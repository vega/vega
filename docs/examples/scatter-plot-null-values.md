A configurable scatter plot of movie statistics, including [IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/) and [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/) review scores. Null values in one or more dimensions are depicted along the margins to better convey missing values. Tooltips are included for interactive inspection of individual movies.

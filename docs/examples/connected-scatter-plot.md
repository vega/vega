A connected scatter plot uses line segments to connect consecutive scatter plot points, for example to illustrate trajectories over time. This example shows the shifting relationship between the price of gas and the average number of miles driven in a year, adapted from [Driving Shifts Into Reverse](http://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2010/05/02/business/02metrics.html) by Hannah Fairfield, _The New York Times_ (May 2, 2010).

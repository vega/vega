[Treemaps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treemapping) display hierarchical data as a set of nested rectangles. This example shows the software class hierarchy of the Flare visualization toolkit (a precursor to D3 and Vega). Node areas are proportional to the file size in bytes of each source code file.

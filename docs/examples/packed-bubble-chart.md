A packed bubble chart displays relatively sized circles arbitrarily packed together. You can change the shape of the packing by adjusting the x or y gravity. This example shows dummy categorical data where node areas are proportional to the amount value.

This Vega example made by David Bacci [@PBI-David](https://github.com/PBI-David).

[Parallel coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_coordinates) visualize multi-dimensional data by representing each dimension as a parallel axis, and drawing individual data records as lines connecting points on each axis. Line crossings indicate negative correlation, and different axis orderings may reveal different patterns of interest.

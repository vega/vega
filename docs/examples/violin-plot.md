A [violin plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violin_plot) visualizes a distribution of quantitative values as a continuous approximation of the probability density function, computed using [kernel density estimation (KDE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_density_estimation). The densities are additionally annotated with the [median](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median) value and [interquartile range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interquartile_range), shown as black lines. Violin plots can be more informative than classical [box plots](../box-plot).

A [ridgeline plot](http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2017/07/joyplots.html) showing the prevalence of various food and beverage categories in Seattle's University District. One never has to go far for coffee! Similar to a [violin plot](../violin-plot), this plot uses a continuous approximation of discrete data computed using [kernel density estimation (KDE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_density_estimation). This graphic originally appeared in [Alaska Airlines Beyond Magazine (Sep 2017, p. 120)](http://www.paradigmcg.com/digitaleditions/abm-0917/html5/).

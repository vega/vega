A [box plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_plot) summarizes a distribution of quantitative values using a set of summary statistics. Here, the boxes show the [interquartile range (IQR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interquartile_range), with the white bar indicating the [median](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median) value. The thin lines ("whiskers") currently show the extent of the minimum and maximum values; other values, such as whiskers extending 1.5 * IQR from each end of the box, are often used as well. See the [violin plot example](../violin-plot) for an alternative approach.

[Brushing and linking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brushing_and_linking) is an interaction technique that highlights points based on linked selections across multiple views. Brushing and linking can be particularly useful for exploring relationships in multi-dimensional data. This example uses an interactive scatter plot matrix of penguin measurements, and echoes the original [Brushing Scatterplots](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1269768) paper by Becker &amp; Cleveland. Click and drag on the visualization to initiate a linked selection.

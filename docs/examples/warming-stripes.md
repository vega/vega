Warming stripes (sometimes referred to as climate stripes, climate timelines or stripe graphics) are data visualization graphics 
that use a series of coloured stripes chronologically ordered to visually portray long-term temperature trends.
Warming stripes reflect a "minimalist" style, conceived to use colour alone to avoid technical distractions 
to intuitively convey global warming trends to non-scientists. [Wikipedia: Warming stripes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warming_stripes)

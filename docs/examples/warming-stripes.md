Warming stripes (sometimes referred to as climate stripes, climate timelines or stripe graphics) are data visualization graphics 
that use a series of coloured stripes chronologically ordered to visually portray long-term temperature trends.
Warming stripes reflect a "minimalist" style, conceived to use colour alone to avoid technical distractions 
to intuitively convey global warming trends to non-scientists. [Wikipedia: Warming stripes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warming_stripes)

Originaly designed by [Wikipedia: Ed Hawkins (climatologist)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Hawkins_(climatologist)).

This Vega example made by Andrzej Leszkiewicz [@avatorl](https://github.com/avatorl)

This implementation of the warming stripes chart has a legend. And the chart is interactive: hover over a color stripe to highlight the stripe.
The tick on the left side of the legend shows temperature for the selected stripe (year) or 0Â°C if cursor is not on the stipres.

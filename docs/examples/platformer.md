A proof of concept of a platformer game in Vega, made by [@xyzrr](https://github.com/xyzrr) to promote the [Weights & Biases machine learning visualization IDE](https://wandb.ai/wandb/posts/reports/The-W-B-Machine-Learning-Visualization-IDE--VmlldzoyNjk3Nzg). Use WASD to move and jump, and press shift in the air to dash. Uses assets from the video game [Celeste](http://www.celestegame.com/).

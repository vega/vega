| aspect              | {% include type t="Boolean" %} | A boolean flag (default `true`) indicating if the image aspect ratio should be preserved across sizes. If `true` and only one of the dimensional (*width* or *height*) properties are defined, the other dimensional property will be calculated to match the aspect ratio of the loaded image file.|

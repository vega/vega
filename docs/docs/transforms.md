**Transforms** process a data stream to filter data, calculate new fields, or derive new data streams. Transforms are typically specified within the `transform` array of a [data](../data) definition. In addition, transforms that do not filter or generate new data objects can be used within the `transform` array of a [mark](../marks) definition to specify post-encoding transforms.

The following example defines a new data set with transforms to filter values and then compute a stacked layout (e.g., for a stacked bar chart):

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "name": "table",
      "transform": [
        { "type": "filter", "expr": "datum.value > 5" },
        { "type": "stack", "field": "value", "groupby": ["category"] }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

All transforms require a _type_ property, specifying the name of the transform. Transforms that produce a value as a side-effect (in particular, the [bin](bin), [extent](extent), and [crossfilter](crossfilter) transforms) can include a _signal_ property to specify a unique signal name to which to bind the transform's state value.

## Basic Transforms

Transforms for processing streams of data objects.

- [`aggregate`](aggregate) - Group and summarize a data stream.
- [`bin`](bin) - Discretize numeric values into uniform bins.
- [`collect`](collect) - Collect and sort all data objects in a stream.
- [`countpattern`](countpattern) - Count the frequency of patterns in text strings.
- [`cross`](cross) - Perform a cross-product of a data stream with itself.
- [`density`](density) - Generate values drawn from a probability distribution.
- [`dotbin`](dotbin) - Perform density binning for dot plot construction. {% include tag ver="5.7" %}
- [`extent`](extent) - Compute minimum and maximum values over a data stream.
- [`filter`](filter) - Filter a data stream using a predicate expression.
- [`flatten`](flatten) - Map array-typed fields to data objects, one per array entry. {% include tag ver="3.1" %}
- [`fold`](fold) - Collapse selected data fields into _key_ and _value_ properties.
- [`formula`](formula) - Extend data objects with derived fields using a formula expression.
- [`identifier`](identifier) - Assign unique key values to data objects.
- [`kde`](kde) - Estimate smoothed densities for numeric values. {% include tag ver="5.4" %}

- [`window`](window) - Calculate over ordered groups, including ranking and running totals.

## Geographic and Spatial Transforms

Transforms for modeling spatial data, cartographic projection, and geographic guides.

- [`contour`](contour) - _Deprecated._ Model a spatial distribution using discrete levels.

## Layout Transforms

Transforms for calculating spatial coordinates to achieve various layouts.

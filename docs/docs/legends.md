**Legends** visualize scale mappings for visual values such as color, shape and size. Similar to scales and axes, legends can be defined either at the top-level visualization, or within the scope of a [group mark](../marks/group).


## Legend Properties

Properties for specifying a legend. Legends accept one or more [scales](../scales) as parameters. At least one of the _size_, _shape_, _fill_, _stroke_, _strokeDash_, or _opacity_ properties **must** be specified. If multiple scales are provided, they **must** share the _same domain_ of input vales. Otherwise, the behavior of the legend is undefined.

| Property      | Type                           | Description    |
| :------------ |:------------------------------:| :------------- |
| type          | {% include type t="String" %}  | The type of legend to include. One of `symbol` for discrete symbol legends, or `gradient` for a continuous color gradient. If `gradient` is used only the _fill_ or _stroke_ scale parameters are considered. If unspecified, the _type_ will be inferred based on the scale parameters used and their backing scale types.|
| direction     | {% include type t="String" %}  | The direction of the legend, one of `"vertical"` (default) or `"horizontal"`.|
| orient        | {% include type t="String" %}  | The orientation of the legend, determining where the legend is placed relative to a chart's data rectangle (default `right`). See the [legend orientation reference](#orientation). |
| fill          | {% include type t="String" %}  | The name of a scale that maps to a fill color. |
| opacity       | {% include type t="String" %}  | The name of a scale that maps to an opacity value. |
| shape         | {% include type t="String" %}  | The name of a scale that maps to a shape value. |
| size          | {% include type t="String" %}  | The name of a scale that maps to a size (area) value. |
| stroke        | {% include type t="String" %}  | The name of a scale that maps to a stroke color. |
| strokeDash    | {% include type t="String" %}  | The name of a scale that maps to a stroke dash value. |
| strokeWidth   | {% include type t="String" %}  | The name of a scale that maps to a stroke width value. {% include tag ver="5.0" %} |
| encode        | {% include type t="Object" %}  | Optional mark encodings for custom legend styling. Supports encoding blocks for `legend`, `title`, `entries`, `labels`, `symbols` and `gradient`. See [custom legend encodings](#custom). |
| format        | {% include type t="String|TimeMultiFormat" %}  | The format specifier pattern for legend labels. For numerical values, must be a legal [d3-format](https://github.com/d3/d3-format#locale_format) specifier. For date-time values, must be a legal [d3-time-format](https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format#locale_format) specifier or a [TimeMultiFormat object](../types/#TimeMultiFormat). |
| formatType    | {% include type t="String" %}  | Specifies the type of format to use (`"number"`, `"time"`, `"utc"`) for scales that do not have a strict domain data type. This property is useful for formatting date-time values for ordinal scales. If specified, the *format* property must have a valid specifier pattern for the given type. Supported {% include tag ver="5.1" %}, UTC support {% include tag ver="5.8" %}. |
| gridAlign     | {% include type t="String" %}  | The alignment to apply to symbol legends rows and columns. The supported string values are `all`, `each` (the default), and `none`. For more information, see the [grid layout documentation](../layout). |

The `line-top` and `line-bottom` values {% include tag ver="5.10" %} operate similarly to `top` and `bottom`, but are calculated relative to the *lineHeight* rather than *fontSize* alone. |
| labelColor    | {% include type t="Color" %}   | Text color for legend labels. |
| labelFont     | {% include type t="String" %}  | Font name for legend labels. |
| labelFontSize | {% include type t="Number" %}  | Font size in pixels for legend labels. |

| labelOverlap  | {% include type t="Boolean|String" %} | The strategy to use for resolving overlap of labels in gradient legends. If `false`, no overlap reduction is attempted. If set to `true` (default) or `"parity"`, a strategy of removing every other label is used. If set to `"greedy"`, a linear scan of the labels is performed, removing any label that overlaps with the last visible label.|
|labelSeparation| {% include type t="Number" %}  | The minimum separation that must be between label bounding boxes for them to be considered non-overlapping (default `0`). This property is ignored if *labelOverlap* resolution is not enabled. {% include tag ver="5.0" %} |

| symbolStrokeWidth | {% include type t="Number" %} | Default legend symbol stroke width. |
| symbolType    | {% include type t="String" %}   | Default [symbol mark shape type](../marks/symbol/) (such as `"circle"`) for legend symbols. |
| tickCount     | {% include type t="Number|String|Object" %}  | The desired number of tick values for quantitative legends. For scales of type `time` or `utc`, the tick count can instead be a time interval specifier. Legal string values are `"millisecond"`, `"second"`, `"minute"`, `"hour"`, `"day"`, `"week"`, `"month"`, and `"year"`. Alternatively, an object-valued interval specifier of the form `{"interval": "month", "step": 3}` includes a desired number of interval steps. Here, ticks are generated for each quarter (Jan, Apr, Jul, Oct) boundary.|
| tickMinStep   | {% include type t="Number" %}  | The minimum desired step between tick values for quantitative legends, in terms of scale domain values. For example, a value of `1` indicates that ticks should not be less than 1 unit apart. If `tickMinStep` is specified, the `tickCount` value will be adjusted, if necessary, to enforce the minimum step value. {% include tag ver="5.0" %} |
| title         | {% include type t="String|String[]" %}  | The title for the legend (none by default). For versions {% include tag ver="5.7" %}, a string array specifies a title with multiple lines of text.|
| titleAnchor   | {% include type t="String" %}  | The anchor position for placing the legend title. One of `"start"`, `"middle"`, `"end"`, or `null` (default, for automatic determination). For example, with a _titleOrient_ of `"top"` these anchor positions map to a left-, center-, or right-aligned title relative to the legend contents. {% include tag ver="5.0" %} |
| titleAlign    | {% include type t="String" %}  | Horizontal text alignment of the legend title. One of `"left"`, `"center"`, or `"right"`. If specified, this value overrides automatic alignment based on the _titleOrient_ and _titleAnchor_ values. |
| titleBaseline | {% include type t="String" %}  | Vertical text baseline of the legend title. One of `alphabetic` (default), `top`, `middle`, `bottom`, `line-top`, or `line-bottom`. The `line-top` and `line-bottom` values {% include tag ver="5.10" %} operate similarly to `top` and `bottom`, but are calculated relative to the *lineHeight* rather than *fontSize* alone. If specified, this value overrides the automatic baseline based on the _titleOrient_ and _titleAnchor_ values. |
| titleColor    | {% include type t="Color" %}   | Text color of the legend title. |
| titleFont     | {% include type t="String" %}  | Font name of the legend title. |
| titleFontSize | {% include type t="Number" %}  | Font size in pixels of the legend title. |

| titlePadding  | {% include type t="Number|Value" %} | The padding between the legend title and entries.|
| values        | {% include type t="Array" %}   | Explicitly set the visible legend values. The array entries should be legal values in the backing scale domain.|
| zindex        | {% include type t="Number" %}  | The integer z-index indicating the layering of the legend group relative to other axis, mark, and legend groups. The default value is `0`.|

### Accessibility Properties {% include tag ver="5.11" %}

Accessibility properties are used to determine [ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA) when using Vega to render SVG output.

| Property      | Type                           | Description    |
| :------------ | :----------------------------: | :------------- |
| aria          | {% include type t="Boolean" %} | A boolean flag (default `true`) indicating if ARIA attributes should be included (SVG output only). If `false`, the "aria-hidden" attribute will be set on the output SVG group, removing the legend from the ARIA accessibility tree. |
| description   | {% include type t="String" %}  | A text description of this legend for ARIA accessibility (SVG output only). If the *aria* property is `true`, for SVG output the ["aria-label" attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques/Using_the_aria-label_attribute) will be set to this description. If the description is unspecified it will be automatically generated. |

### Themes and Configuration

To create themes, new default values for legend properties can be set using a [config](../config/#legends) object. The config object also supports [customized layout](../config/#legends-layout) behavior for collections of legends with the same *orient* value.


## <a name="orientation"></a>Legend Orientation Reference

Valid settings for the legend _orient_ parameter.

| Value          | Description |
| :------------- | :---------- |
| `left`         | Place the legend to the left of the chart. |
| `right`        | Place the legend to the right of the chart. |
| `top`          | Place the legend above the top of the chart. |
| `bottom`       | Place the legend below the bottom of the chart. |
| `top-left`     | Place the legend inside the upper left corner of the chart.|
| `top-right`    | Place the legend inside the upper right corner of the chart.|
| `bottom-left`  | Place the legend inside the lower left corner of the chart.|
| `bottom-right` | Place the legend inside the lower right corner of the chart.|
| `none`         | Do not perform automatic layout. Allows custom layout by setting the `x` and `y` properties within a `legend` encoding block.|

_Multiple legends_: If multiple legends have a `left` or `right` orientation, they will be vertically ordered. If multiple legends have a `top` or `bottom` orientation, they will be horizontally ordered. In all other cases, legends will be drawn on top of each other when placed in the same location.

_Legend offset_: In the case of `left`, `right`, `top` and `bottom` orientation, the _offset_ parameter determines how far away the legend is placed from the rest of the chart. If the orientation is `none`, the _offset_ parameter is ignored. For all other settings, the _offset_ determines the distance the legend is moved inward from a corner of the data rectangle.


## <a name="custom"></a>Custom Legend Encodings

Custom mark properties can be set for all legend elements using the _encode_ parameter. The addressable elements are:

- `legend` for the legend [group](../marks/group) mark,
- `title` for the title [text](../marks/text) mark,
- `labels` for label [text](../marks/text) marks,
- `symbols` for legend [symbol](../marks/symbol) marks,
- `entries` for symbol legend [group](../marks/group) marks containing a symbol / label pair, and
- `gradient` for a gradient [rect](../marks/rect) marks: one rect with gradient fill for continuous gradient legends, multiple rect marks with solid fill for discrete gradient legends.

Each element accepts a set of visual encoding directives grouped into `enter`, `update`, `exit`, _etc._ objects as described in the [Marks](../marks) documentation. Mark properties can be styled using standard [value references](../types/#Value).

In addition, each encode block may include a string-valued `name` property to assign a unique name to the mark set, a boolean-valued `interactive` property to enable input event handling, and a string-valued (or array-valued) `style` property to apply default property values. Unless otherwise specified, title elements use a default style of `"guide-title"` and labels elements use a default style of `"guide-label"`.

Each legend symbol and label instance is backed by a data object with the following fields, which may be accessed as part of a custom visual encoding rule:

- `index` - an integer index
- `label` - the string label
- `value` - the data value
- `size` - the symbol size (for symbol legends only)

The following example shows how to set custom fonts and a border on a legend for a fill color encoding. The `labels` encoding block also make legend labels responsive to input events, and changes the text color on mouse hover.

{: .suppress-error}
```json
"legends": [
  {
    "fill": "color",
    "encode": {
      "title": {
        "update": {
          "fontSize": {"value": 14}
        }
      },
      "labels": {
        "interactive": true,
        "update": {
          "fontSize": {"value": 12},
          "fill": {"value": "black"}
        },
        "hover": {
          "fill": {"value": "firebrick"}
        }
      },
      "symbols": {
        "update": {
          "stroke": {"value": "transparent"}
        }
      },
      "legend": {
        "update": {
          "stroke": {"value": "#ccc"},
          "strokeWidth": {"value": 1.5}
        }
      }
    }
  }
]
```

Custom text can be defined using the `text` property for `labels`. For example, one could define an ordinal scale that serves as a lookup table from a backing `value` to legend label text. In addition, one can set the `x` and `y` properties for the `legend` to perform custom positioning when _orient_ is `none`.

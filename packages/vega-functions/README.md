# vega-functions

Function implementations for the [Vega expression language](https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/expressions/). Unlike the basic utility functions included in the [vega-expression](https://github.com/vega/vega/tree/master/packages/vega-expression) package, this package includes custom expression functions, many of which are specific to Vega dataflows.
